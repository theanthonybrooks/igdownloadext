Basic chrome extension that downloads profile pictures from IG. Used for gathering logos for The Street Art List, though could potentially be useful in other instances.  

v.1.0 - Simple interface w/o popup. Only downloads by default and takes the username of the profile as the image filename(.jpg). 
v1.2.1 - Added buttons/functionality for both download and copy to clipboard.
